# de4dot-GUI-Utility
Little tool to use de4dots string decryption feature without having to make a batch file. You need de4dot for this to work

Code is a little messy, will try to clean it up in the future.


### Usage
- Put this app in your de4dot folder or manually set the path to de4dot.exe in the Settings tab
- Drag & Drop your obfuscated files on the Form
- Set the String Decryption settings you want and enter the method token or path to the method
- Let de4dot do its work

### Thanks to
